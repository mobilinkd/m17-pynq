    "# M17 for Pynq\n",
    "\n",
    "This project explores the direct transmission and reception of M17 radio\n",
    "on VHF and UHF.  This transmitter is based on work done on an arbitrary\n",
    "clock generator (or NCO) for Pynq in 2019.\n",
    "\n",
    "This ACG work was inspired by two things.  First, I was playing around with\n",
    "an Adafruit Si5351A module, trying to make a quadrature clock for testing\n",
    "a Quadrature Sampling Detector (QSD), also known as a\n",
    "[Tayloe Mixer](https://wparc.us/presentations/SDR-2-19-2013/Tayloe_mixer_x3a.pdf),\n",
    "and noticed that the phase and duty cycle change based on frequency.  I have\n",
    "no idea if this causes a problem at the HF and low VHF frequencies of\n",
    "interest (6m - 160m amateur radio bands), but it seemed less than ideal.\n",
    "\n",
    "Second was discovering [an article](https://zipcpu.com/blog/2019/06/28/genclk.html)\n",
    "by Dan Gisselquist [@ZipCPU](https://twitter.com/zipcpu) on implementing an\n",
    "arbitrary clock generator for an Artix-7 board.  I had been thinking about\n",
    "doing such a thing but I'm an FPGA newbie and didn't really know where to\n",
    "start.  Most of what I needed to implement this for Pynq is available in Vivado\n",
    "IP Integrator.  The remaining bits were trivial to implement in HLS.\n",
    "\n",
    "The NCO uses a high-speed (for the Zynq-7020) SERDES output to generate a\n",
    "very rough clock signal.  This is then fed into a clock input and cleaned\n",
    "up with a PLL, providing a very stable clock.  The PLL has a wide lock range.\n",
    "As long as we stay within the bounds of the PLL's input range, we can create\n",
    "a very accurate and clean clock signal.\n",
    "\n",
    "This clock is then used to drive another SERDES pin that outputs a constant\n",
    "010101... signal using DDR at 4x the input frequency.  The maximum output\n",
    "frequency is 900MHz; the maximum TX frequency is half that.\n",
    "\n",
    "This means we can cover up to the top of the 70cm band.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, let's get started.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Organization\n",
    "\n",
    "This project is organized into 4 key components.\n",
    "\n",
    " 1. This top-level document.\n",
    " 2. The HLS code to implement the fractional divider.\n",
    " 3. The Vivado IP Integrator project and block design.\n",
    " 4. The Pynq code, implemented as [another notebook](Pynq/acg-pynq.ipynb).\n",

    "# Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "As a software engineer, I always like to start with the requirements of a project\n",
    "before getting started so I know what I am aiming for.  Since this is an exploratory\n",
    "project, the requirements are more along the lines of \"see if this will work\" but\n",
    "lets see what I am aiming for.\n",
    "\n",
    "I am considering creating a low-power amateur radio transceiver, starting with a\n",
    "receiver and eventually progressing to a transmitter, capable of 160m - 6m\n",
    "(1.8-54.0MHz), using a QSD.  This requires two clock outputs in quadrature\n",
    "(90 degrees phase offset).  We would like tuning precision to be within 1Hz over\n",
    "the whole range, but we can live with less precision if necessary.  We would like\n",
    "phase jitter to be below 100ps and duty cycle to be 50% +/- 0.5%.\n",

    "# Fractional Clock Divider\n",
    "\n",
    "We are going to generate a 32-bit fractional clock divider.  To get the precision\n",
    "I am aiming for, I need only 24 bits, but old habits die hard.  And the example I\n",
    "am basing this off of used 32 bits.\n",
    "\n",
    "The code is pretty straight-forward.  Our interface takes a increment and\n",
    "forever generates a clock based on this value. To disable it, set the increment to 0.\n",
    "The increment is used to update an accumulator the clock (mostly).\n",
